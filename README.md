# Backloggd-like clone

A clean, fast, and customizable static site template for tracking your video game collection and reviews. Heavily inspired by the design of [Backloggd](https://backloggd.com/).

Made when Backloggd made the decision to remove Black Souls I and II from their database.
## Features

*   **Self-Hosted:** You own your data. No databases, just Markdown files.
*   **Visual Grid:** Beautiful grid layouts for your game collection.
*   **Customizable Theme:** Change the entire color scheme (backgrounds, text, accents) directly from the config file.
*   **Interactive Sidebar:** Dynamic ratings graph, bio, and social links.
